    <h1>Why to start another blog in 2025.</h1>
<p>I’ve always been online. Ever since I got my first PC at 10 years old, I was hooked. I remember building websites on Geocities—never quite finishing them, of course. They were full of blinking &quot;Under Construction&quot; GIFs, random buttons, and ambitious dreams of entire sections that never materialized. But something about that process creating something out of nothing, tinkering with HTML just to see what happens, stuck with me. Somehow, it quietly shaped the path I’d take in life.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few decades, and here I am: 38 years old, still playing with websites.</p>
<p>This one feels different, though. I built it not because I <em>had</em> to, but because I <em>wanted</em> to. I wanted a space of my own again. Not a feed. Not a profile. Not something built for likes, followers, or metrics. Just a small, honest corner of the internet where I can write, reflect, and share things that matter to me—whether that's about marketing, AI, internet culture, or simply some photos and ideas I want to keep around.</p>
<p>Back in 2020, I quit most social media. I didn’t make a big announcement—I just stopped. It was a tough moment in my life, mentally and emotionally, and the constant stream of perfect snapshots from everyone else's lives started to feel... heavy. Like a performance I didn’t want to be part of anymore. Since then, I haven’t really gone back.... not in the way I used to. I don’t post stories. I barely scroll through them.</p>
<p>But I’m in a much better place now. Stepping away helped me reset. Not knowing every detail of everyone’s lives has made real-world conversations more meaningful. When I meet up with people, the stories they share are actually new. There's something magical about that.</p>
<p>So this site is my way of being online again (just differently). A quieter, slower, more personal presence. A place to create, to think, and to keep building... just like I did when I was 10, except now with a bit more perspective</p>
